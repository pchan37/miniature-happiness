City On Our Knees 
Until The Whole World Hears 
Give This Christmas Away 
Hold My Heart 
What Faith Can Do 
I'll Be Brave This Christmas 
Forgiven 
The Night Before Christmas 
The Words I Would Say 
Joy To The World (Unspeakable Joy) 
Emmanuel (Hallowed Manger Ground) 
On And On 
How He Loves 
Let The Waters Rise 
Alive Again 
Heaven Is The Face 
He Has Come For Us (God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen) 
Christmas Time 
Sing, Sing, Sing 
Alive 
Always 
There Is A Way 
Salvation Is Here 
Winter Snow 
Go Tell It On The Mountain 
Sometimes 
When Love Was Born 
Your Hands 
Follow You 
From The Inside Out 
Joy To The World 
You Are The Reason 
God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen 
Adore Him 
Finally Christmas 
Again 
God Bless Us 
Don't You Know You're Beautiful 
He Is With You 
Heartbeat 
Hark! The Herald Angels Sing 
Safe 
It's Christmas Day 
Christmas Is 
Mess Of Me 
Glorious 
Open Hands 
Hands 
Glory To God In The Highest 
Offering (Christmas)
