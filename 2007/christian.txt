O Come, O Come Emmanuel 
Born In Bethlehem 
Made To Love 
Do You Hear What I Hear? 
Stand In The Rain 
Tonight 
Drifter 
Wherever We Go 
Rebirthing 
Made To Worship 
Mary Did You Know 
O Come All Ye Faithful 
Silent Night 
The Face Of Love 
Breathe You In 
Lost At Sea 
I Will Lift My Eyes 
Dead Man (Carry Me) 
What It Means 
The Virgin's Lullaby 
Does Anybody Hear Her 
Glory To God In The Highest 
Big Enough 
Hold Fast 
I Heard The Bells 
Mary Sweet Mary 
Someday 
The Show 
Shine On 
Angels We Have Heard On High
