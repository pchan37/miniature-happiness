# Website: The Beauty of Lightsteelblue
By PChan, Zicheng Zhen, Yikai Wang, Richard Wang

## Project Description
Due to our musical interest, we decide to create a webpage that offers users a quick and efficient mean of
finding trends in popular genres, songs, authors, etc between various years.

## Data Visualization
Our site will utilize a stacked bar graph and a color map to display musical data from people living in
the United States of America.

#### Stacked Bar Graph
With the stacked bar graph, we plan to display quick facts about popular musical genres that are color
coded so that users can extract information quickly and effectively.  The most popular genre will be shown
at the top of the bar and in decreasing popularity as we move down the bar.  We will display the year at
the top of the graph with arrows allowing the users to adjust the year in an intuitive manner.

#### Color Map
With the color map, we plan to break up the data by states.  Instead of doing it by the general genre, we
will display color coded facts for each state as you click on it for that particular year.  Like the
stacked bar graph, the year will be displayed at the top and there would be arrows on either side allowing
quick and intuitive adjustment of the years.
