Give Me Your Eyes 
There Will Be A Day 
I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day 
By Your Side 
Lose My Soul 
You're Here 
Slow Fade 
While You Were Sleeping 
You Reign 
All Creation Sing (Joy To The World) 
Jesus Messiah 
I Need A Silent Night 
Yours 
Revelation 
God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen 
Streets Of Gold 
Silver Bells 
Emmanuel 
Hope Now 
End Of Me 
It's The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year 
Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas 
Joy To The World 
Angels We Have Heard On High 
Pull Me Out 
A New Hallelujah 
Keys To The Kingdom 
One Life To Love 
Crying For A Christmas 
God Has Come To Earth
